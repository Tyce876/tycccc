                        <h1>Portland</h1>
                       <p> Portland is a parish located on Jamaicaâ€™s 
                        northeast coast. It is situated to the north of St Thomas and the east of St. Mary. 
                        The parish is known for its natural beauty, stunning beaches, lush vegetation,
                         multiple caves and rivers as well as the peak of the Blue Mountain range. 
                         It lies in the direct path of the prevailing northeast trade winds that bring rain,
                        and its hilly terrain trap the winds and ensure almost daily rainfall.</p>

                        <h1>StThomas</h1>
                        <p>St. Thomas is bordered by St. Andrew on the west, Portland on the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south. The land mass of St. Thomas ranges from the peaks of the Blue Mountains and John Crow Mountains down to sea-level.\
                             Subsidiary ridges of the Blue Mountain range, running from east to west across the island,
                             come to their eastern end in St. Thomas. These include the Port Royal Mountain Range,
                             which rises in some parts to 1,219.2m (4,000 feet) and stretches from above New Castle,
                             in St. Andrew, to a point near the sea in the Albion area of St. Thomas.

                        </p>
                        <h1> St Mary</h1>
                        <p>The parish of St. Mary is bordered by Portland in the East, St. Ann in the West,
                             and parts of St. Catherine and St. Andrew in the South. It is mostly mountainous,
                              rising up to almost 4000 feet at the highest point with just under 13 per cent of its area having slopes below 10 degrees.
                               There are three (3) main rivers in St. Mary: the Rio Nuevo River, Wag Water and White Rivers.
                             These rivers are often slow, and at times create swamps in the surrounding area.</p>

                             <h1>St Ann</h1>
                             <p>Situated on the north coast of the island, St. Ann is bounded on the east by the parish of St.
                                 Mary, and on the west by the parish of Trelawny.  It shares its southern borders with the parishes of St. Catherine and Clarendon. The dominant range is the Dry Harbour Mountains, but individual peaks such as Mount Diablo, 
                                 Mount Alba and Mount Zion are prominent. On the plains, the soil type is predominantly limestone, which, along with the many rivers, gives rise to numerous caves and sinkholes. Some 60 caves have been noted throughout the parish,
                                 of which the most famous is the Green Grotto, in Runaway Bay.</p>
